XmlParser v0.999
================
XmlParser is a wrapper for _org.xmlpull.v1.XmlPullParser_, which allows to load structured data from XML.


Usage
----------------
`XmlParser parser = new XmlParser(getResources().getXML(R.xml.something), factory)` <br/>
`XmlParser parser = new XmlParser(this, R.xml.something, factory)` <br/><br/>
`factory` here is an object, that implements `TagAcceptorFactory` interface. You can use `HashMapFactory`,
 which generates HashMapTags with public `name`, `params`, `nested` tags and `value` (see `XmlParserTest` for examples).
<br/><br/>
`HashMapFactory` is easy in use, but don't do any real work for you. The better idea is to use your common tag acceptors, generated by your own factory.
 There are different ways to make your own tag acceptors. First of all, you can simply implement `TagAcceptor`, but it's interface could be changed in few time.
 Better way is to extend abstract `SimpleTagAcceptor` or `TagAcceptorWithDictionaryParams`. You also can suggest another abstract classes which you found to be usefull

 Custom factory usage example will be somewhere
